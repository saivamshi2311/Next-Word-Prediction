# 🧠 Next Word Prediction using NLP

This project demonstrates a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application for **Next Word Prediction** using a deep learning model. The objective is to predict the next most probable word given an input sequence of text, similar to the behavior of smart suggestions in messaging or writing applications.

## 🚀 Overview

- **Input**: A sequence of words (text)
- **Output**: The most likely next word predicted by the model
- **Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NLP preprocessing

## 🛠️ Features

- Text cleaning, tokenization, and sequence generation from raw text
- Vocabulary creation using Keras Tokenizer
- LSTM-based deep learning model for next-word prediction
- Embedding layer to represent words in dense vectors
- Predictive text generation using trained model

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python (3.8+)
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for training visualizations)
- NLTK / Keras Tokenizer (for NLP preprocessing)


## 📊 Model Architecture

- Embedding Layer
- LSTM Layer(s)
- Dense Output Layer with Softmax activation

## 🧪 How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NLP-Next-Word-Prediction.git
cd NLP-Next-Word-Prediction
