proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program . </s>', '<s> But the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation . </s>', '<s> Legislators weary </s>', \"<s> Indeed , the

need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes . </s>', '<s> This would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cash . </s>', '<s> It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year . </s>', '<s> If the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill , or any other tax bill , it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma . </s>', '<s> Since the constitution

back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor . </s>', '<s> It is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem . </s>', '<s> But if all

done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature , so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year . </s>', '<s> A constant problem

Sportsman of the Year '' by Sports Illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the `` Professional Athlete of the Year '' , a distinction that earned for him the $10,000 diamond-studded Hickok Belt . </s>\", '<s> But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot . </s>', '<s> A couple of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole . </s>', '<s> It made him human . </s>', '<s> And it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair . </s>', '<s> If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all . </s>', '<s> It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold . </s>', '<s> He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all . </s>', \"<s> The world's best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher . </s>\", '<s> He boomed a 280-yard drive . </s>', '<s> Then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance . </s>', '<s> No margin for error </s>', '<s> On the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole , Arnold whipped into his second shot . </s>', '<s> The ball went off in a majestic arc , an out-of-bounds slice . </s>', '<s> He tried again and once more sliced out of bounds . </s>', '<s> He hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side . </s>', \"<s> `` It is possible that I over-corrected '' , he said ruefully . </s>\", '<s> Each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes . </s>', '<s> So he wound up with a dozen . </s>', \"<s> `` It was a nice round figure , that 12 '' , he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too much perturbed . </s>\", '<s> From the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open . </s>', '<s> The idol of the hackers , of course , is Ray Ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the United States Open . </s>', '<s> Their secondary hero is another pro , Willie Chisholm , who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully . </s>', \"<s> Willie's partner was Long Jim Barnes , who tried to keep count . </s>\", '<s> Stickler for rules </s>', \"<s> `` How many is that , Jim '' ? ? </s>\", '<s>

had a 16 . </s>', \"<s> Palmer's dozen were honestly earned . </s>\", '<s> Nor were there any rules to save him . </s>', '<s> If there had been , he would have found a loophole , because Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book . </s>', '<s> This knowledge has come in handy , too . </s>', '<s> His first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway . </s>', '<s> The ball floated downstream . </s>', '<s> A spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy , who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie . </s>', '<s> Arnold sent for Joe Dey , the executive secretary of the golf association . </s>', '<s> Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream . </s>', \"<s> `` I knew it all along '' , confessed Arnold with a grin , `` but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there '' . </s>\", '<s> For a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity , Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings . </s>', '<s> Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors . </s>', \"<s> He'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he's right . </s>\", \"<s> That's how he first won the Masters in 1958 . </s>\", '<s> It happened on the twelfth hole , a 155-yarder . </s>', \"<s> Arnold's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains , thereby bringing local rules into force . </s>\", '<s> Ruling from on high </s>', \"<s> `` I can remove the ball , can't I '' ? ? </s>\", '<s> Asked Palmer of an official . </s>', \"<s> `` No '' , said the official . </s>\", \"<s> `` You must play it where it lies '' . </s>\", \"<s> `` You're wrong '' , said Arnold , a man who knows the rules . </s>\", \"<s> `` I'll do as you say , but I'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling '' . </s>\", '<s> He scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one . </s>', '<s> The golfing fathers ruled in his favor . </s>', '<s> So he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke . </s>', '<s> Until a few weeks ago , however , Arnold Palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers . </s>', '<s> But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became one of the boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before . </s>', '<s> A

S. and Soviet heads of Government have met three times since Sir Winston Churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace `` at the summit of the nations '' . </s>\", \"<s> The first time was in 1955 when a full-dress Big Four summit meeting produced the `` spirit of Geneva '' . </s>\", '<s> The spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow made inroads into the Middle East . </s>', '<s> In 1959 President Eisenhower and Premier Khrushchev held an informal session in the U.

S. for the U-2 incident . </s>', \"<s> The episode tended to confirm the U. S. belief that propaganda , the hope of one-sided concessions , and the chance to split the Allies , rather than genuine negotiation , were the Soviet leader's real aims in summitry . </s>\", '<s> Pre-inaugural position </s>', '<s> Thus when Premier Khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new President , Mr. Kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem . </s>', '<s> Shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the Soviet leader in these words : </s>', \"<s> `` As long as Mr. Khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way , no amount of either smiles or toughness , neither Camp David talks nor kitchen debates , can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations '' . </s>\", '<s> The President had set for himself the task , which he believed vital , of awakening the U. S. and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance . </s>', '<s> He did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary . </s>', \"<s> He wanted time , too , to review the United States' global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating . </s>\", \"<s> Above all , he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to Premier Khrushchev's doorstep . </s>\", '<s> Attitude flexible </s>', '<s> At the same time the President took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leader . </s>', '<s> Ideally , he knew , it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels . </s>', '<s> But Mr. Kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting , provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it . </s>', \"<s> It would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war , to try to probe Mr. Khrushchev's intentions and to make clear his own views . </s>\", '<s> Moreover , an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the U. S. was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions . </s>', '<s> Both elements -- the caution about a meeting , the willingness eventually to hold one -- were reflected in a letter from the President which Ambassador Llewellyn E. Thompson brought back to Russia late in February . </s>', '<s> The letter , dated Feb. 22 , was delivered to Premier Khrushchev in Novosibirsk , Siberia , on March 9 . </s>', '<s> It dealt mainly with a broad range of East-West issues . </s>', '<s> But it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with Mr. Khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted . </s>', '<s> Developments over the next two months , however , caused the President to reconsider the question of the timing . </s>', '<s> There were intense discussions in the inner councils of the White House about the advisability of an early meeting , not because the international climate was improving , but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly . </s>', '<s> Deadlock on tests </s>', '<s> The President was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at Geneva . </s>', \"<s> The deadlock has been caused by the Russians' new demand for a three-man ( East , West and neutral ) directorate , and thus a veto , over the control machinery . </s>\", '<s> In the U. S. , strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the Russians may be secretly testing . </s>', '<s> Mr. Kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown , or even continued stalemate , would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament . </s>', '<s> There was reason to believe that Premier Khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons , particularly to Communist China . </s>', '<s> The question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the Soviet leader had not become urgent . </s>', '<s> Moreover , Moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies , including the U. N. Secretariat and the International Control Commission for Laos . </s>', '<s> Mr. Kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements , or even negotiations , impossible . </s>', '<s> Developments in Cuba and Laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting . </s>', '<s> Initially the White House reaction was that the bitter exchanges with Moscow over Cuba and the conflict in Laos had dampened prospects for a meeting . </s>', \"<s> At the same time , there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the Soviet leader , as a result of those episodes , come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the West's ability and determination to resist Communist pressure . </s>\", '<s> In Cuba , the U. S. had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against Communist penetration even on its own doorstep . </s>', '<s> In Laos , the picture was almost equally bad . </s>', \"<s> U. S. willingness to accept a neutral Laos may have led Premier Khrushchev to believe that other areas could be `` neutralized '' on Soviet terms . </s>\", '<s> Beyond that , Allied disagreement about military intervention in Laos -- despite warnings that they might do so -- allowed Moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the pro-Communist forces . </s>', '<s> As a result , the West is in a poor bargaining position at the current Geneva negotiations on Laos , and South Vietnam and other nations in Southeast Asia are under increased pressure . </s>', '<s> In the light of those events , there appeared to be a real danger that Premier Khrushchev might overreach himself . </s>', \"<s> Ambassador Thompson reported from Moscow that the Soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive . </s>\", '<s> He has indicated that he plans new moves on Berlin before the year is out . </s>', '<s> The President and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn Premier Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as Berlin , Iran or Latin America from which there would be no turning back . </s>', '<s> It was in the midst of such White House deliberations that Premier Khrushchev on May 4 made new inquiries through the U.

S. , the simultaneous announcements issued in Washington and Moscow last Friday emphasized the `` informal '' nature of the meeting . </s>\", '<s> The Washington announcement said : </s>', '<s> `` The President and Chairman Khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries . </s>', \"<s> The meeting will , however , afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries '' . </s>\", '<s> The outlook </s>', \"<s> The Vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned , 67-year-old veteran of the cold war who , in Mr. Kennedy's own words , is `` shrewd , tough , vigorous , well-informed and confident '' , and a 44-year-old President ( his birthday is May 29 ) with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy . </s>\", '<s> The announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the U. S. of both approval and disapproval . </s>', '<s> The approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at Vienna . </s>', '<s> The inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations . </s>', '<s> But those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary . </s>', '<s> Mr. Khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men . </s>', '<s> The feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the President and that plain talk by Mr. Kennedy would give him pause . </s>', '<s> Apart from the personal equation , another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the U.S. appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit . </s>', '<s> Premier Khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway . </s>', '<s> This time the initiative came , in part at least , from Washington . </s>', '<s> Other allies consulted </s>', '<s> There was also the fact that by the time he meets Mr. Khrushchev , the President will have completed conversations with all the other principal Allied leaders . </s>', '<s> Thus he will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunity . </s>', \"<s> Finally , there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the President's making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord . </s>\", '<s> There is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world . </s>', '<s> If tests are to be resumed , the argument went , it is vital that the U. S. make plain that the onus belongs to the Soviet Union . </s>', '<s> Disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse . </s>', \"<s> After Cuba and Laos , it was argued , Mr. Khrushchev will interpret the President's consent to the meeting as further evidence of Western weakness -- perhaps even panic -- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds . </s>\", \"<s> Moreover , the President is meeting the Soviet leader at a time when the Administration has still not decided on the scope of America's firm foreign policy commitments . </s>\", '<s> The question was raised , for example , as to what attitude the President would take if Mr. Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from Southeast Asia to the Middle East . </s>', '<s> There are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory . </s>', '<s> Mollusks are a case in point . </s>', '<s> The shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development . </s>', '<s> Though this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . </s>', '<s> There can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . </s>', '<s> The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . </s>', '<s> By way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence . </s>', '<s> There is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture . </s>', '<s> Viewing the American Catholic educational achievement in retrospect , we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university . </s>', '<s> But the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official American Catholic project ; ; </s>', '<s> certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy . </s>', '<s> Official encouragement is one thing , but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds . </s>', \"<s> American Catholics have responded generously to bishops' and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning . </s>\", '<s> They have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made . </s>', '<s> Diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility . </s>', '<s> All of this may be understandable enough : it is , however , in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise . </s>', '<s> Yet for better or for worse , the truth of the matter is that most American Catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general Catholic support but rather to the initiative , resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities . </s>', '<s> Community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible . </s>', '<s> To understand the past history -- and the future potential -- of American Catholic higher education , it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community . </s>', '<s> It is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment . </s>', '<s> A religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere . </s>', '<s> The fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension . </s>', '<s> The net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship , the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship . </s>', \"<s> American Catholic colleges and universities are , in a very real sense , the product of `` private enterprise '' -- the `` private enterprise '' of religious communities . </s>\", '<s> Had it not been for such private enterprise , diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees . </s>', \"<s> There is however no point in speculating about such a possibility : the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the `` family business '' . </s>\", \"<s> This `` family-community '' spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement . </s>\", '<s> It is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of American Catholic higher education , in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas . </s>', \"<s> I think for example of three women's colleges with pitifully small enrollments , clustered within a few miles of a major Catholic university , which is also co-educational . </s>\", '<s> This is not an isolated example ; ; </s>', '<s> this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough . </s>', '<s> It would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot . </s>', \"<s> Apart , however , from the question of wasteful duplication , there is another aspect of the `` family business '' spirit in American Catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny . </s>\", \"<s> For while the past needs of the Church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions , which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools , it would seem that today's need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its `` pursuit of excellence '' . </s>\", \"<s> At the earlier `` pre-academic excellence '' stage of Catholic education , the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis . </s>\", \"<s> But with today's demand for professional qualifications and specialized training , the need for `` outsiders '' becomes more pressing . </s>\", \"<s> The problem is not merely that more `` outside teachers '' are needed but that a different brand is called for . </s>\", \"<s> Commenting on the earlier stage , the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors ( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making ) noted that the term `` teacher-employee '' ( as opposed to , e.g. , `` maintenance employee '' ) was a not inapt description . </s>\", \"<s> Today however , the `` outsider '' is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order ( otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him ) and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university . </s>\", '<s> And while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene , the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement . </s>', '<s> In the above mentioned report of the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors , the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it : `` Even with the best of intentions he ( the President of the university ) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which , considered ( as it must be by him ) in individual terms , is inhomogeneous , mortal and of extremely varying temperament , interests and capabilities . </s>', \"<s> It is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are , in their opinion , identified with its highest good and ( to use that oft-repeated phrase ) ' the attainment of excellence ' '' . </s>\", \"<s> The pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to Notre Dame : it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by `` the organization which actually owns '' it , becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished `` outside '' faculty . </s>\", \"<s> It is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to `` the organization which actually owns the university '' : this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension . </s>\", '<s> But in any case , one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one . </s>', \"<s> `` Outside '' faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business . </s>\", '<s> There are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the Catholic university . </s>', '<s> In the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel . </s>', '<s> Word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession , much given to attending meetings and conferences . </s>', '<s> Expressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a Catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype . </s>', '<s> In the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott : all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the Catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere . </s>', '<s> To appreciate the nature of the gamble , it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security , that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the Civil Service . </s>', '<s> Much has been made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure . </s>', '<s> This is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated . </s>', '<s> When a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion , not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services . </s>', \"<s> A man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the `` family '' . </s>\", '<s> Just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices , it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major Catholic institutions . </s>', '<s> Adequate compensation is indispensable . </s>', '<s> Yet adequate compensation -- and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place . </s>', '<s> Broadly speaking the total Catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university . </s>', \"<s> Religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification . </s>\", '<s> There is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that , at the college level , the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels . </s>', '<s> The college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication , even informal debates over the luncheon table , are a contribution to the total good of the institution . </s>', '<s> But this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation . </s>', \"<s> The second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the `` in-group '' that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees , is , therefore , the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself . </s>\", '<s> This is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure . </s>', '<s> Yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control , there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order . </s>', '<s> The first is a negative warning : there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority . </s>', \"<s> In the case of academic personnel the `` feeling '' of participation can hardly be `` faked '' . </s>\", \"<s> Competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own decisions . </s>\", \"<s> Those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by `` busy-work '' and ersatz decision making . </s>\", '<s> In any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all . </s>', \"<s> In the Notre Dame report , reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to `` luncheon-table communication '' . </s>\", \"<s> In itself there is nothing wrong with this form of `` participation '' : the only difficulty on the Catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy , i.e. , members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution , have their own eating arrangements . </s>\", '<s> Sen. John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws . </s>', '<s> Once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally . </s>', \"<s> Or , in the words of Anatole France , `` The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges '' . </s>\", \"<s> The public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites . </s>\", '<s> The Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program . </s>', '<s> In addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill . </s>', \"<s> It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike . </s>\", '<s> Business Week ( Aug. 9 , 1961 ) reports that the United Aircraft Company , against which the International Association of Machinists had undertaken a strike , decided to keep its plants operating . </s>', '<s> The company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable to four factors : advertising to attract new employees , hiring and training them , extra overtime , and defective work performed by the new workers . </s>', \"<s> The company has billed the United States Government for $7,500,000 of these expenses under the Defense Department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business . </s>\", '<s> Rep. Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the Armed Services Committee . </s>', '<s> The committee remains unresponsive . </s>', '<s> Neither has Congressman Martin nor Senator McClellan been heard from on the matter ; ; </s>', '<s> they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions . </s>', '<s> The recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained . </s>', '<s> The anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete , but along completely undefined lines ; ; </s>', '<s> it must play a game in which there never is a winner . </s>', '<s> The fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law . </s>', '<s> Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy . </s>', '<s> Let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which General Electric , Westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market . </s>', '<s> The industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated -- whether marginal or average pricing is applied . </s>', '<s> The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment . </s>', '<s> Accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price . </s>', '<s> Naturally , enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time . </s>', '<s> Should these giants really flex their competitive muscles , they would become the only survivors in the industry . </s>', \"<s> Uncle Sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by `` unfair competition '' . </s>\", \"<s> But if they show self-restraint , they don't get the orders . </s>\", '<s> Under the circumstances , the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted . </s>', '<s> Engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants . </s>', '<s> The paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government , after the conviction , that General Electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows . </s>', '<s> In other words , the anti-trust laws , designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday , Wednesday and Friday , become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday . </s>', '<s> And which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday ? ? </s>', \"<s> The question might be asked : `` Don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts ? ? </s>\", \"<s> Why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas , throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter , expressing their complete confidence in the laws '' ? ? </s>\", '<s> The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by Thurman Arnold , in The Folklore of Capitalism , back in 1937 . </s>', '<s> He wrote : `` ( P. 211 ) the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations , and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure . </s>', '<s> ( P. 214 ) anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship . </s>', '<s> ( P. 215 ) when corporate abuses were attacked , it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control . </s>', '<s> In this manner , every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws . </s>', \"<s> ( Pp. 228-229 ) in any event , it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known , held together by some of the most fantastic ideas , all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government '' . </s>\", \"<s> This escape from control has led to management's evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while . </s>\", '<s> A plea of nolo contendere , followed by a nominal fine , after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license . </s>', '<s> ( The penalties handed out in the electrical case , which included jail sentences , were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions , perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities . </s>', '<s> ) </s>', '<s> If a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market , quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest . </s>', '<s> A secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle . </s>', '<s> However , one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational . </s>', '<s> Quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational -- and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union . </s>', '<s> Those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform . </s>', '<s> Before 1933 , individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain English . </s>', '<s> The acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 , implicit in the writing of Section 7A of the National Industrial Recovery Act , has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle . </s>', '<s> The Wagner Act , the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining . </s>', '<s> The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition . </s>', '<s> If a union cannot perform this function , then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud . </s>', '<s> The tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession . </s>', '<s> The problem must be faced squarely . </s>', '<s> If laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn ( unsupported , by the way , by any agricultural subsidy ) , then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them . </s>', '<s> Human labor was exactly that -- a commodity -- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America . </s>', '<s> As early as 1776 , Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth Of Nations : `` We have no acts of Parliament against combining to lower the price of work ; ; </s>', \"<s> but many against combining to raise it '' . </s>\", '<s> Eighteenth-century England , upon whose customs our common law was built , had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies . </s>', \"<s> In 1825 , the Boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers , who declared : `` It is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies '' . </s>\", '<s> There were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining , but against labor monopoly . </s>', '<s> The courts shared the opinion of the employers . </s>', '<s> In People vs. Fisher , Justice Savage of the New York Supreme Court declared : </s>', '<s> `` Without any officious and improper interference on the subject , the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it ; ;

Congressman Martin , according to the Daily Labor Report of Sept. 19 , 1961 , defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor `` if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages , production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages , hours and conditions of employment '' . </s>\", '<s> Senator McClellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation . </s>', '<s> His bill , allegedly aimed at Hoffa , would amend the Sherman , Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union -- even a sister local in the same international . </s>', '<s> Paradoxically , the same week in which Senator McClellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation , the Civil Aeronautics Board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel , the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act . </s>', '<s> Indeed , it is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws ; ; </s>', '<s> for example , the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers . </s>', '<s> At the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation , a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates . </s>', '<s> The passage of the Sherman Act was aimed at giant monopolies . </s>', '<s> It was most effective against trade unions . </s>', '<s> In the famous Danbury Hatters case , a suit was brought against the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices , e.g. , trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer . </s>', '<s> The suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment . </s>', '<s> In 1914 , the Clayton Act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity . </s>', '<s> The law could not suspend economics . </s>', '<s> Labor remained a commodity -- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization

Long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on Sunday have become meteorological footnotes , the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between Arnold Palmer and Gary Player . </s>', '<s> Unlike most such sports rivalries , it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously , although this was not exactly the case . </s>', \"<s> When the winter tour began at Los Angeles last January there was no one in sight to challenge Palmer's towering prestige . </s>\", '<s> As if to confirm his stature , he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments . </s>', '<s> Player won only one . </s>', '<s> But as the tour reached Pensacola a month ago , Player was leading Palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars , and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere . </s>', '<s> On the final round at Pensacola , the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player in the same threesome and , although it was far from obvious at the time , the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come . </s>', '<s> On that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading the tournament and , as it turned out , neither won it . </s>', '<s> But whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour . </s>', '<s>

week , together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date . </s>', '<s> Instant rivalry </s>', '<s> On Thursday , the first day of the Masters , the contest between Palmer and Player developed instantly . </s>', '<s> It was a dismal , drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the Augusta National course . </s>', '<s> The usually skiddy greens were moist and soft , so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences . </s>', \"<s> Palmer's 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead , which he shared with Bob Rosburg . </s>\", '<s> But Player was only one stroke back , with a 69 . </s>', '<s> Even so , it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators -- unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever -- that this tournament was to be , essentially , a match between Palmer and Player . </s>', '<s> A lot of people were still thinking about Jack Nicklaus , the spectacular young amateur , who had a 70 ; ; </s>', '<s> or Ken Venturi , who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better ; ; </s>', \"<s> or Rosburg , whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries ; ; </s>\", '<s> or even old Byron Nelson , whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf .

the tournament came clearly into focus . </s>', '<s> Rosburg had started early in the day , and by the time Palmer and Player were on the course -- separated , as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend , by about half an hour -- they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg , who ended with a 73 , was not having a good day . </s>', '<s> As Player began his second round in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman , his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender . </s>', '<s> Player began with a birdie on the first hole , added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th . </s>', '<s> On the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament . </s>', '<s> He birdied the 13th , the 15th and the 18th -- five birdies , one bogey and 12 pars for a 68 . </s>', '<s> Starting half an hour behind Player in company with British Open Champion Kel Nagle , Palmer birdied the 2nd , the 9th , the 13th and the 16th -- four birdies , one bogey and 13 pars for a 69 . </s>', \"<s> The roar of Palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of Augusta , only to be answered moments later by the roar of Player's gallery for a similar triumph . </s>\", '<s> At one point late in the day , when Palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th , a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the final hole . </s>', '<s> Without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed ( although he later admitted that he had ) Palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer , and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply . </s>', '<s> The boldness of champions </s>', '<s> Anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course . </s>', '<s> It is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence . </s>', '<s> The bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions . </s>', '<s> Bob Jones played that way . </s>', '<s> Byron Nelson did , Hogan did . </s>', '<s> And last week at the Masters Palmer and Player did . </s>', \"<s> As the third round of the tournament began on Saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest , it was Player's superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead . </s>\", '<s> This day Palmer had started first . </s>', '<s> As Player stepped on the first tee he knew that Palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day . </s>', '<s> Player immediately proceeded to follow suit . </s>', '<s> In fact , he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well , to go 4 under par for the first eight holes . </s>', \"<s> But Player's real test came on the ninth hole , a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards . </s>\", '<s> He hit a poor tee shot , pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways . </s>', '<s> Having hit one of the trees , the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out . </s>', '<s> Player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 , or gambling . </s>', '<s> The latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse , hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green . </s>', \"<s> `` I was hitting the ball well '' , Player said later , `` and I felt strong . </s>\", \"<s> When you're playing like that you'd better attack '' . </s>\", '<s> Player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget . </s>', '<s> It struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge . </s>', '<s> From there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4 . </s>', '<s> Palmer , meanwhile , had been having his troubles . </s>', '<s> They started on the 4th hole , a 220-yard par-3 . </s>', '<s> On this day the wind had switched 180-degrees from the northwest to the southeast , and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days . </s>', '<s> At the 4th tee Palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club , so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green . </s>', '<s> His bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par . </s>', '<s> Starting the second nine , Palmer was already four strokes behind Player and knew it . </s>', \"<s> When Mickey Charles Mantle , the New York Yankees' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime . </s>\", \"<s> When Roger Eugene Maris , Mantle's muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe . </s>\", \"<s> But when tiny , 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels , who once caught

Ciudad Trujillo means freedom for the people of the Caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered . </s>', '<s> Trujillo knew a great deal about assassination . </s>', '<s> The responsibility for scores of deaths , including the abduction and murder of Jesus Maria Galindez , a professor at Columbia University in New York , has been laid at his door . </s>', '<s> He had been

time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow the Venezuelan government , reportedly involving the use of Dominican arms by former Venezuelan Dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez , has been uncovered and

Unquestionably Trujillo did some good things for his country : he improved public facilities such as roads and sanitation , attracted industry and investment and raised the standard of living notably . </s>', '<s> But the price was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition . </s>', \"<s> El Benefactor's vanity grew with his personal wealth . </s>\", '<s> The jails were filled to

often this profession was accepted here as evidence of his good character . </s>', \"<s> Tardily the Government here came to understand how this country's own reputation was tarnished by the association with repression . </s>\", '<s> Last year , after Trujillo had been cited for numerous aggressions in the Caribbean , the United States and many other members of the Organization of American States broke diplomatic relations with him . </s>', '<s> Thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines . </s>', \"<s> Trujillo's dictatorship had been along conservative , right-wing lines . </s>\", '<s> But after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing Communist slogans . </s>', '<s> There was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with Castro in Cuba , previously a bete noire to Trujillo -- thus illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces . </s>', '<s> What comes after Trujillo is now the puzzle . </s>', '<s> The Dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation , and all alternative leadership has been suppressed . </s>', '<s> Perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability , but the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger . </s>', '<s> The Dominican Republic could turn toward Communist-type authoritarianism as

promulgating separately the laws for the two areas . </s>', '<s> Then they moved offices of the East German puppet government into East Berlin and began illegally to treat it as the capital of East Germany . </s>', \"<s> That this and the closing of the East Berlin-West Berlin border have not been accepted by the Western governments appears in notes which Britain , France , and the United States sent to Moscow after the latter's gratuitous protest over a visit of Chancellor Adenauer and other West German officials to West Berlin . </s>\", '<s> The Chancellor had as much business there as Ulbricht had in East Berlin -- and was certainly less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of Gerhard Eisler . </s>', \"<s> The British and other replies to that Moscow note pointed out

was never loquacious , and his word , once given , was not subject to retraction . </s>', '<s> It might be added that as he kept his word so he expected that others keep theirs . </s>', '<s> The demonstration of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical . </s>', '<s> His leadership was not for audiences . </s>', '<s> A growl , a nod , was usually enough . </s>', '<s> When it was not , one of the great dramas of Washington would be presented . </s>', '<s> He would rise in the well of the House , his chin upon his chest , his hands gripping the side of a desk , and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence . </s>', '<s> He spoke briefly , sensibly , to the point and without oratorical flourishes . </s>', '<s> He made good , plain American common sense and the House usually recognized it and acted upon it . </s>', '<s> These public efforts were rare because Mr. Rayburn normally did his counseling , persuading and educating long before an issue reached its test on the House floor . </s>', '<s> He expected Democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them . </s>', '<s> With his long service he had a long memory , an excellent thing in a political leader . </s>', '<s> He was , of course , in the House for a very long time . </s>', '<s> There are only two men remaining in Congress who , with Rayburn , voted for the declaration of war against Germany in 1917 . </s>', '<s> To almost two generations of Americans it must have seemed as though the existence of Mr. Sam coincided with that of the House . </s>', '<s> And it was the House he loved . </s>', '<s> To be presiding officer of it was the end of his desire and ambition . </s>', \"<s> The Senate to him was not the `` upper body '' and he corrected those who said he served `` under '' the president . </s>\", \"<s> He served `` with '' him . </s>\", '<s> Sound the roll of those with whom he served and who preceded him in death . </s>', '<s> Woodrow Wilson , with whom he began his years in Washington , Warren G. Harding , Calvin Coolidge , FDR , with whom he managed a social revolution . </s>', '<s> And those still with us , Herbert C. Hoover , Harry S. Truman , Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy . </s>', '<s> He was a fighter for those of his own party . </s>', \"<s> Mr. Truman has only to recall the `` hopeless '' campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of Mr. Kennedy with Congress would have been sadder than it was had not Mr. Sam been there . </s>\", '<s> As it was , his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration . </s>', '<s> With Republican presidents , he fought fair . </s>', '<s> He was his own man , not an automatic obstructionist . </s>', '<s> He kept his attacks on Republicanism for partisan campaigns , but that is part of the game he was born to play . </s>', '<s> Under any name -- Mr. Speaker , Mr. Democrat , Mr. Sam -- he was a good man . </s>', '<s> un off the Congo track </s>', '<s> Thirteen Italian airmen who went to the Congo to serve the cause of peace under the United Nations banner have instead met violent death at the hands of Congolese troops supposedly their friends . </s>', '<s> In 18 months , no more grisly incident has been reported from that jungle . </s>', '<s> Simply out of bloodlust , their murderers dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into the river . </s>', '<s> The excuse was offered for them that they had mistaken the Italians for Belgian mercenaries . </s>', '<s> In other words , atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central government might be condoned , had the victims been serving the cause of dissident Katanga . </s>', '<s> Does this suggest that the Congo is fit for nationhood or that UN is making any progress whatever toward its goal of so making it ? ? </s>', '<s> To the contrary , through the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence . </s>', '<s> Mass rapes , troop mutinies , uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures , given no sanction by any political authority , have become almost daily occurrences . </s>', '<s> Yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is not the work of Katanga . </s>', '<s> It happens in the territory of the Leopoldville government , which is itself a fiction , demonstrably incapable of governing , and commanding only such limited credit abroad as UN support gives it . </s>', '<s> The main question raised by the incident is how much longer will UN bury its head in the sand on the Congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in present terms ? ? </s>', '<s> The probable answer is that it will do so just as long as Russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young African nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on Central Africa . </s>', '<s> Right now , they are pushing a resolution which would have UN use its forces to invade and subjugate Katanga . </s>', '<s> That notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several points of view . </s>', '<s> The UN army is too weak , too demoralized for the task . </s>', '<s> Further , it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned . </s>', '<s> Last , it makes no sense to deliver Katanga , the one reasonably solid territory , into the existing chaos . </s>', '<s> The Congo should have been mandated , because it was not ready for independence . </s>', '<s> The idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed over wisdom . </s>', '<s> It is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism . </s>', '<s> But if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the General Assembly , it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach . </s>', '<s> Otherwise , UN will march blindly on to certain defeat . </s>', '<s> Featherbed reversal </s>', '<s> A recent editorial discussing a labor-management agreement reached between the Southern Pacific Co. and the Order of Railroad Telegraphers has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information . </s>', \"<s> The editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year . </s>\", \"<s> Our comment was that this was `` featherbedding '' in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such an agreement . </s>\", '<s> The statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers , but that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life . </s>', '<s> Additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need . </s>', '<s> Also , normal personnel attrition would make the job reduction provision more or less academic . </s>', '<s> The situation with regard to the Southern Pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries . </s>', '<s> The solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in a series of union demands . </s>', '<s> Meditations from a fallout shelter </s>', '<s> Time was when the house of delegates of the American Bar association leaned to the common sense side . </s>', '<s> But the internationalists have taken over the governing body of the bar , and when the lads met in St. Louis , it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the United Nations was scarcely less than wonderful , despite an imperfection here and there . </s>', \"<s> It was , the brief writers decided , `` man's best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world '' . </s>\", \"<s> Peace , it's wonderful , and `` world law '' , it's wonderful , too , and shouldn't we get an international covenant extending it into space , before the Russians put some claim jumper on the moon ? ? </s>\", \"<s> Meanwhile , in Moscow , Khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of TNT , to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can't see the justice of surrendering West Berlin to communism . </s>\", \"<s> A nuclear pacifier of these dimensions -- roughly some six and a half times bigger than anything the United States has triggered experimentally -- would certainly produce a bigger bang , and , just for kicks , Khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from St. Louis to the moon , where there wouldn't even be any beer to drink . </s>\", \"<s> While he was at it , the philosopher of the Kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who can't appreciate coexistence thru suicide . </s>\", \"<s> `` Fools '' , he bayed , `` what do you think you are doing '' ? ? </s>\", \"<s> The only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren't playing the marimba with our shoes in the United Nations , but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort . </s>\", '<s> Another evidence of the spreading rule of reason was provided from Mexico City with the daily hijacking of an American plane by a demented Algerian with a gun . </s>', \"<s> The craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to Havana , where , for some unknown reason , Castro rushed to the airport to express mortification to the Colombian foreign minister , a passenger , who is not an admirer of old Ten O'Clock Shadow . </s>\", '<s> The plane was sent back to the United States , for a change , but Castro kept the crazy gunman , who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution . </s>', \"<s> Less respect for the legal conventions was displayed by Castro's right hand man , Che Guevara , who edified the Inter-American Economic and Social council meeting in Montevideo by reading two secret American documents purloined from the United States embassy at Caracas , Venezuela . </s>\", '<s> The contents were highly embarrassing to American spokesmen , who were on hand to promise Latin Americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium . </s>', '<s> Perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing American diplomatic papers and planes , but the Kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that , but for its own incompetence in protecting American interests , these things would not happen . </s>', '<s> The same can be said about the half-hearted Cuban invasion mounted by the administration last April , which , we trust , is not symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious Khrushchev . </s>', \"<s> Pass the iron rations , please , and light another candle , for it's getting dark down here and we're minded to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away . </s>\", '<s> The customer loses again </s>', '<s> . </s>', '<s> The board of suspension of the Interstate Commerce commission has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates on grain , as they had planned to do this month . </s>', '<s> The request for lower rates originated with the Southern railway , which has spent a good deal of time and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional , smaller car . </s>', '<s> By reducing rates as much as 60 per cent , it and its associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have lost to truckers and barge lines . </s>', \"<s> The board's action shows what free enterprise is up against in

to grips with cold war issues . </s>', '<s> His firm hand will be desperately missed . </s>', '<s> Mr. Hammarskjold was in Africa on a mission of peace . </s>', \"<s> He had sought talks with Moise Tshombe , the secessionist president of Congo's Katanga province where recent fighting had been bloody . </s>\", '<s> He earnestly urged a cease-fire . </s>', '<s> The story of the fatal crash is not fully known . </s>', '<s> The U.N.-chartered plane which was flying from the conference city of Ndola in Northern Rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun bullets last weekend and was newly repaired . </s>', '<s> Whether this , or overt action , was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined . </s>', \"<s> The death of Mr. Hammarskjold removes the United Nations' most controversial leader . </s>\", '<s> He was controversial because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom with justice . </s>', '<s> He courageously defended the rights of small nations , and he stood his ground against the savage attacks of the Communist bloc . </s>', '<s> The Congo , in whose cause he died , was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs . </s>', '<s> His policies had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war and workable solutions were beginning to take shape . </s>', '<s> When the recent Katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions Mr. Hammarskjold , despite the danger , flew to exert a calming influence . </s>', '<s> He gave his life for his beliefs . </s>', '<s> The U.N. session scheduled for today will meet under the cloud of his passing . </s>', '<s> It
